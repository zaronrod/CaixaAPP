Room is a Database Object Mapping library that makes it easy to access database on Android applications.
Rather than hiding the details of SQLite, Room tries to embrace them by providing convenient APIs to query the database and also verify such queries at compile time.
This allows you to access the full power of SQLite while having the type safety provided by Java SQL query builders.

There are 3 major components in Room.
1) Database: This annotation marks a class as a database. It should be an abstract class that extends RoomDatabase. At runtime, you can acquire an instance of it via Room.databaseBuilder or Room.inMemoryDatabaseBuilder.
The database class defines the list of entities and data access objects in the database. It is also the main access point for the underlying connection.
2) Entity: This annotation marks a class as a database row. For each Entity, a database table is created to hold the items. The Entity class must be referenced in the Database#entities array. Each field of the Entity (and its super class) is persisted in the database unless it is denoted otherwise (see Entity docs for details).
3) Dao: This annotation marks a class or interface as a Data Access Object. Data access objects are the main components of Room that are responsible for defining the methods that access the database. The class that is annotated with Database must have an abstract method that has 0 arguments and returns the class that is annotated with Dao. While generating the code at compile time, Room will generate an implementation of this class.
Using Dao classes for database access rather than query builders or direct queries allows you to keep a separation between different components and easily mock the database access while testing your application.
